Tracker2D Class

Purpose:
Track objects in 2D space using an array of quasi-monostatic doppler radars.

Description:
Each radar will keep track of it's peak response velocity and acceleration.
Least-squares will be used to triangulate the velocity and acceleration of the max frequency response from all radars.
	* A solution using both acceleration calculated on a per-radar level, and on a fused velocity level will be done
	* Start using three radars to simplify the solution - baseline measurement
