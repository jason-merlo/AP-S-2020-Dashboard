1) Initialize track location
Loop:
   2) Calculate radial distance to track from each radar
   3) Sample doppler velocities and convert from spherical to cartesian on tracking plane
   4) Update radius based on received doppler velocity and computed acceleration
   5) Calculate intersection of radar radial distance circles
   6) Find points from each circle forming the Triangle with the smallest area
   7) Compute centroid of Triangle
   8) Store centroid as new track location
